# Pong Arcade Game

## Overview

My Pong Arcade Game is an adaption of the 1972 arcade classic by Sega. It was written in vanilla JavaScript, some css and the good old HTML canvas. My purpose with this project was building my skills on object oriented JavaScript. 

I used some parts of the game engine provided by the Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree and added my own libraries for keyHandling and collision detection. This Game could be used as a tutorial project for the Udacity Frogger Game.
